👋 Hi, I’m @Param-Patel-o5

👀 I’m interested in how AI thinks, how humans decide, and how good design can make both look better on social media.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, DSA, and diving into AI/ML — especially Deep Learning and Computer Vision — while pursuing Electrical Engineering and creating graphic designs for social media.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly AI/ML or creative content projects that combine tech + visual storytelling.

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve slept 19 hours in one day… and survived on just 5 hours across 3 days. My sleep schedule runs its own AI model 😴🤖
